          In rune land, magic is everything.

          Here, magic is not just a mysterious concept of energy. It is a materialized substance that can be guided, shaped, shaped and manipulated. The magic of rune land has its own laws of nature. The results of random variations in source ecological magic change the laws of science.

          There are several continents in the runes, but all life is concentrated in the largest magical land, Valoran. Valoran is located in the center of Rune Land and is the largest continent in rune land.

          Blessed Rune land has a great deal of source ecological magic energy that its inhabitants can tap into. The central region of the Rune land is a great concentration of source ecological magic energy, and these places are ideal locations for crystal hubs. The Crystalline hub shapes the source energy into a materialized being of itself. In addition, the Crystal Hub can be used as an energy workshop to power buildings that require magical energy. Crystal hubs are scattered throughout the land of runes, but the largest crystal hubs are located on the continent of Valoran
